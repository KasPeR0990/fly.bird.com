motion tracking bird game. 



uses opencv to track motion. no images stored. 





Develop a browser-based game that integrates real-time camera input and body motion tracking. The player’s upper body movements (captured through the device’s camera) will control a bird character’s movement in the game. The game must include realistic physics, including gravity, acceleration, and responsive movement mechanics.

General Requirements:

The game runs in the browser.

The device camera is displayed in real time at the top right of the game screen.

The application must request and obtain camera permissions from the user.

Use the camera feed to capture body movements with a skeleton overlay, focusing only on the upper body.

Map the detected body motions to control the bird’s movements in the game.

Implement physics for realistic movement, including gravity, acceleration, and turning dynamics.

Detailed Steps with Checkpoints:

Initialization & Camera Setup:

Task: Set up a basic web page that integrates a live camera feed.

Subtasks:

Create an HTML page with a dedicated area (at the top right) for the real-time camera feed.

Write JavaScript to request camera permissions and display the live feed.

Action: Once the camera setup is implemented, pause and output the current code and a brief summary. Wait for explicit confirmation before moving to the next step.

Body Motion Tracking:

Task: Integrate a motion tracking library to capture body movements using a skeleton overlay.

Subtasks:

Import and configure a motion tracking library (e.g., PoseNet, MediaPipe, etc.).

Focus on tracking the upper body (torso and arms).

Overlay the skeleton on the live camera feed to confirm correct body setup.

Action: After successfully setting up and verifying the body tracking, stop and provide a summary of the implementation. Wait for feedback before proceeding.

Mapping Player Movements to Bird Movement:

Task: Translate the player's body motions into game controls for a bird character.

Subtasks:

Define movement mechanics:

Gliding: Arms stretched straight out → smooth, gravity-influenced gliding.

Turning (Left/Right): Angling the upper body/torso in the respective direction (use provided image references for visual guidance).

Diving: Bending forward with arms slightly down → increased acceleration.

Flying (Gaining Speed & Height): Vertical arm movements mimicking bird flapping.

Gaining More Height: Flapping while angling the torso upward.

Code the logic to capture these movements and translate them into corresponding movements of the bird character within the game.

Action: Present the mapping logic and sample code for review. Pause for feedback before continuing.

Implementing Game Physics:

Task: Add realistic physics to the game.

Subtasks:

Introduce gravity that continuously affects the bird.

Implement acceleration mechanics:

Diving increases forward speed.

Faster flapping results in faster movement.

Sharper upper body angling produces tighter turns.

Ensure that physics calculations integrate seamlessly with the movement mapping.

Action: Share the physics implementation details and code snippet. Stop and wait for explicit confirmation before moving to the final integration.

Final Integration & Testing:

Task: Consolidate all components into a single, coherent application.

Subtasks:

Merge the camera setup, body tracking, movement mapping, and physics engine.

Test the full flow: from camera permission to real-time tracking, and from detecting body movements to controlling the bird.

Debug any issues and refine the mappings to ensure smooth gameplay.

Action: Once integrated, provide a final summary and the complete code. Wait for a final review and further instructions.

Key Reminders:

Stop and wait for explicit feedback after each step. Do not proceed until confirmation is given.

Ensure every detail is implemented exactly as specified.

Use clear, direct language and maintain the discrete structure throughout the process.

All code and terminal commands must be in English.
